"Without A Warning" 
By: The Weeknd

[Verse 1: The Weeknd]
Take me to a time
When I was young
And my heart could take the drugs and heartache without loss
But now my bones are frail
And my voice fails
And my tears fall without a warning either way

[Chorus: The Weeknd]
The crowd will scream, the crowd will scream my name
Even when the world wants me to fail
The crowd will scream, the crowd will scream my name
Woah, woah
And the crowd will feel, the crowd will feel my pain
Hope you'll love me 'til my final day
Even if it was in vain
Leave my guts all on the stage

[Interlude: The Weeknd & The Nu'rons]
You I'm thinking of—
Woah-woah
Teardrops come without a warning

[Verse 2: The Weeknd]
Oh, yeah
I don't supposе tomorrow's coming, coming
I'ma follow through this time so the press might bе loving
I'm stuck in a cycle, just wanna feel life from the morning
I should've been sober, but I can't afford to be boring

[Chorus: The Weeknd]
'Cause the crowd will scream, the crowd will scream my name
Even if the world wants me to fail
The crowd will scream, the crowd will scream my name
Woah, woah
And the crowd will feel, the crowd will feel my pain
Hope you'll love me 'til my final day, yeah
Even if it was in vain
Leave my guts all on the stage

[Outro: The Weeknd]
How do I know tomorrow's coming?
Especially when I always kiss the sky
Especially when I always chase the high
I don't suppose tomorrow's coming (How will I know, baby?)
How do I know tomorrow's coming? (How will I know it's coming?)
Especially when I always chased the crown (When I chase it, baby)
Especially when they put me in the ground (So they know what they did)
I don't suppose tomorrow's coming (Hurry up, hurry up)
How do I know tomorrow's coming? (Hurry up, baby)
Especially when I always chase the crown (Oh, oh)
Especially when they put me in the ground
I don't suppose tomorrow's coming
