What is your favorite movie?

My favorite movie is Interstellar by Christopher Nolan.

If you could go anywhere in the world for vacation, where would it be?

If I could go anywhere in the world for vacation, I would go to Portugal.

If you could have any super power, what would it be (and why that power)?

If I could have any super power, it would be time travel. It would be time travel because I would be able to go back and relive some good moments.
